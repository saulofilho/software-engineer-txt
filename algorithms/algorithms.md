Popular Algorithms for System Design Interviews:

• Bloom Filter: Efficiently checks if an item is likely in a set before performing expensive disk operations (may have false positives but no false negatives).

• Geohash: Encodes geographic coordinates into short strings for location-based services and spatial indexing.

• HyperLogLog: Estimates the number of distinct elements in large datasets with minimal memory usage (for counting unique queries, visitors, etc.).

• Consistent Hashing: Distributes data across nodes while minimizing redistribution when nodes are added or removed.

• Merkle Tree: Hierarchical hash structure that efficiently detects inconsistencies between data replicas across multiple nodes.

• Raft Algorithm: Consensus algorithm for managing replicated logs across distributed systems.

• Lossy Counting: Identifies frequent items or "heavy hitters" in data streams with limited memory (used in network traffic analysis and web analytics).

• QuadTree: Spatial data structure that recursively subdivides space into quadrants, useful for location-based services and collision detection.

• Operational Transformation: Preserves document consistency in collaborative editing systems by transforming concurrent operations.

• Leaky Bucket: Rate limiting algorithm that controls the flow of requests to protect systems from overload.

• Rsync: Algorithm for efficiently synchronizing files and directories between systems by transferring only differences.

• Ray Casting: Determines whether a point is inside a polygon by counting ray-boundary intersections (used in geospatial analysis and computer graphics).
