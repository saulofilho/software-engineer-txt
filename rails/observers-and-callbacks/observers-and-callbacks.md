# Observers

Observers in Ruby on Rails are used to decouple logic that is not directly related to an object's lifecycle. They observe changes in a model and trigger actions in response, such as sending notifications or updating related records.

# Callbacks

Callbacks in Ruby on Rails are methods that are triggered at specific points in an object's lifecycle, such as before or after validation, creation, update, or deletion. They allow developers to add custom logic to these events.
