### **1. What is the role of a back-end developer in a web application?**

A back-end developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of a web application. Their role includes:

- **Database Management** – Designing and managing databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
- **Server-Side Logic** – Writing business logic and handling requests, often using languages like Ruby (on Rails), Python (Django/Flask), Node.js, or Java (Spring).
- **API Development** – Creating RESTful or GraphQL APIs to allow front-end and external systems to interact with the application.
- **Authentication & Security** – Implementing authentication (OAuth, JWT) and security measures (encryption, data validation).
- **Performance Optimization** – Improving server performance, caching responses (Redis, Memcached), and scaling infrastructure.
- **Integrations** – Connecting the app to third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email services).

### **2. Difference between Back-End, Front-End, and Full-Stack Development**

- **Back-End Development** – Focuses on the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power the application.
- **Front-End Development** – Deals with the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js.
- **Full-Stack Development** – Involves both front-end and back-end development, enabling a developer to work on the entire web application stack.

### **3. What is a RESTful API, and how does it work?**

A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that follows REST principles:

- **Uses HTTP methods**:
    - `GET` – Retrieve data
    - `POST` – Create new data
    - `PUT` – Update data
    - `DELETE` – Remove data
- **Stateless** – Each request is independent; the server does not store client state.
- **Resource-Based** – Data is accessed via URLs (`/users/1`, `/products/10`).
- **Uses JSON or XML** – Data is usually exchanged in JSON format.

A client (e.g., a web app or mobile app) sends an HTTP request to the API, and the server processes it and returns a response.

### **4. Difference between SOAP and REST**

| Feature | REST | SOAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol | Uses HTTP, JSON/XML | Uses HTTP, SMTP, TCP with XML |
| Simplicity | Simple and lightweight | More complex |
| Performance | Faster (stateless, cacheable) | Slower due to XML overhead |
| Flexibility | Works with various data formats (JSON, XML) | Only XML |
| Use Cases | Web services, APIs for web/mobile apps | Enterprise apps, banking, transactions requiring security |

### **5. What is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern?**

MVC is a **design pattern** that separates an application into three layers:

- **Model** – Handles business logic and data (e.g., Active Record in Rails).
- **View** – Manages the user interface (e.g., HTML, ERB templates).
- **Controller** – Handles user input and orchestrates the flow between the Model and View.

Example in Ruby on Rails:

1. User requests `/users/1`.
2. **Controller** (`UsersController#show`) retrieves user data from the **Model**.
3. **View** (`show.html.erb`) renders the data as HTML.

This separation improves maintainability, scalability, and testability.

**A:**

Using Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm:

1. Two pointers start at the head.
2. One moves one step at a time, the other moves two steps.
3. If they meet, there is a cycle.

```ruby
ruby
CopyEdit
def has_cycle?(head)
  slow = fast = head
  while fast && fast.next
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
    return true if slow == fast
  end
  false
end

```

---

---

Here’s a **deeper dive** into each question, adding more details, alternative approaches, and expanded explanations.

---

## **1. Software Architecture & Design**

### **Q: How would you design a scalable system for millions of users?**

**A:**

To design a **highly scalable system**, you need to address **performance, availability, and resilience**. A typical approach includes:

- **Load Balancing**
    - Use **reverse proxies** like **Nginx, HAProxy, or AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** to distribute requests across multiple servers.
    - Implement **round-robin, least connections, or consistent hashing** strategies.
- **Database Scaling**
    - **Read Replicas**: Offload read operations to replicas.
    - **Sharding**: Split data across multiple databases to prevent a single point of failure.
    - **NoSQL Solutions**: Use **Cassandra, DynamoDB, or MongoDB** for high availability.
- **Caching**
    - Use **Redis/Memcached** to cache frequently accessed data.
    - Implement **CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)** to serve static assets closer to users.
- **Asynchronous Processing**
    - Offload background jobs using **Kafka, RabbitMQ, Sidekiq, or Celery**.
    - Example: Instead of synchronously processing an image upload, queue it for later processing.
- **Microservices vs. Monolith**
    - **Monoliths** are simpler but become harder to scale as they grow.
    - **Microservices** allow independent scaling, but introduce network overhead.
    - Use **API Gateways (Kong, Nginx, AWS API Gateway)** to manage inter-service communication.
- **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**
    - Implement **circuit breakers** (Hystrix) to prevent cascading failures.
    - Use **graceful degradation** (e.g., show cached data if the DB is down).
    - **Health checks** & **auto-recovery** (Kubernetes, AWS Auto Scaling).

---

### **Q: What is the difference between Monolithic and Microservices architectures?**

**A:**

| Feature | Monolithic Architecture | Microservices Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deployment** | Single unit (harder to deploy independently) | Multiple services, independent deployment |
| **Scalability** | Vertical scaling (scaling a single unit) | Horizontal scaling (scaling individual services) |
| **Resilience** | Single point of failure | Failures are isolated to services |
| **Complexity** | Simpler to develop and test | Requires orchestration and communication management |
| **Performance** | Faster (no network latency between components) | Slower due to inter-service communication (API calls, RPC) |

---

## **2. Data Structures & Algorithms**

### **Q: How do you detect a cycle in a linked list?**

**A:**

Two common methods:

### **1. Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare (O(n) time, O(1) space)**

- Uses two pointers moving at different speeds.
- If they meet, there is a cycle.
- If the fast pointer reaches `nil`, no cycle exists.

```ruby
ruby
CopyEdit
def has_cycle?(head)
  slow = fast = head
  while fast && fast.next
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
    return true if slow == fast
  end
  false
end

```

### **2. HashSet Approach (O(n) time, O(n) space)**

- Store visited nodes in a hash set.
- If we visit the same node twice, a cycle exists.

```ruby
ruby
CopyEdit
def has_cycle?(head)
  seen = Set.new
  while head
    return true if seen.include?(head)
    seen.add(head)
    head = head.next
  end
  false
end

```

---

## **3. Distributed Systems**

### **Q: What is a distributed database and what are the challenges?**

**A:**

A **distributed database** runs on multiple nodes, allowing **high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability**.

### **Challenges**:

1. **CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)**
    - **CP** (Consistency & Partition Tolerance) → MongoDB
    - **AP** (Availability & Partition Tolerance) → DynamoDB
    - **CA** is not possible in distributed systems.
2. **Data Replication**
    - **Strong consistency** (leader-follower) vs. **eventual consistency**.
    - **Conflicts in multi-primary setups** (conflict resolution strategies needed).
3. **Partitioning (Sharding)**
    - Hash-based vs. range-based sharding.
    - Handling **rebalancing** when adding/removing nodes.
4. **Failure Handling**
    - Implement **consensus algorithms** (Paxos, Raft) for leader election.

---

## **4. DevOps & Infrastructure**

### **Q: How do you ensure high availability in a system?**

**A:**

1. **Redundancy & Failover**
    - **Multi-region deployments** (AWS/GCP multi-AZ setups).
    - **Database failover** (read replicas, leader election).
2. **Load Balancing**
    - **Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB** to distribute traffic.
3. **Asynchronous Processing**
    - **Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS)** to prevent blocking requests.
4. **Observability**
    - **Metrics (Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic)**.
    - **Tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)**.
    - **Logging (ELK Stack, Splunk)**.

---

## **5. Code & Design Patterns**

### **Q: When would you use the Singleton pattern?**

**A:**

- Use **when only one instance of a class is required**, e.g.,
    - **Logging**
    - **Database connection pools**
    - **Caching (Redis client, in-memory store)**

Example in Ruby:

```ruby
ruby
CopyEdit
class Logger
  @@instance = Logger.new

  def self.instance
    @@instance
  end

  private_class_method :new
end

```

**Anti-pattern warning**:

- Can create hidden dependencies (global state).
- Harder to test due to **tight coupling**.

---

## **6. Security**

### **Q: How do you prevent SQL Injection?**

**A:**

1. **Use Prepared Statements**
    
    ```ruby
    ruby
    CopyEdit
    User.where("email = ?", params[:email])
    
    ```
    
2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    - Never trust user input (use strong type validation).
3. **Use ORM Frameworks**
    - ActiveRecord (Rails), SQLAlchemy (Python), Hibernate (Java) prevent direct SQL manipulation.
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**
    - Restrict database access **only to necessary permissions**.

---

## **7. Behavioral Questions**

### **Q: Tell me about a critical bug you fixed.**

**A:**

1. **Situation**:
    - "In production, we noticed a database connection leak causing high CPU usage."
2. **Action**:
    - "Used `SHOW PROCESSLIST` (MySQL) to find lingering connections."
    - "Identified that a background job was not closing connections properly."
3. **Result**:
    - "After the fix, CPU usage dropped from 90% to 30%, and latency improved by 50%."
