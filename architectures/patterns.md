Here's a quick breakdown of 7 key patterns:

- Layered Architecture
Also called n-tier. Separates concerns into layers: presentation, business logic, persistence, ano database. Easy to understand and implement.

- Microservices
Breaks down an application into small, independent services. Each service owns its data and can be deployed individually. Scales well but adds complexity.

- Monolithic Architecture
A single unit that handles all concerns: Ul, business logic, and data. Easier to start with but harder to scale and maintain as it grows.

- Event-Driven Architecture
Services react to events rather than direct calls.
Great for real-time systems and loose coupling.
Producers emit events, consumers subscribe to them via an event broker.

- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
Splits an application into three components. Controller handles input, model manages data, view displays data. Popular in web development.

- SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)
Applications communicate through a centralized
Enterprise Service Bus. Good for large systems where services need to be reused across platforms.

- Master-Slave
One master node delegates work to one or more slave nodes. Useful for replication, database syncing, or workload distribution.
